In the summer of 2024, I set myself a small personal challenge:  
**write a simple interpreter from scratch**.  

Without a grand vision I started this project.
Just me, some free time, and the curiosity to try something new.

At first, Kocha Lang wasn’t even *Kocha Lang*. The original goal was to build a bare-bones interpreter — a learning project to stretch my skills. But somewhere along the way, I decided to make the process more fun. I thought *"What if I created a programming language entirely in Uzbek street slang?"*

## Shared it
Once I had the basic functionality working, I decided to share it with people.

So I wrote some documentations, created a syntax highlight vs-code extention and released the project in [Tasdev community](https://t.me/tasdev)

Something that started as a *personal joke* quickly became a talked-about project in local developer communities. To be clear, most people treated it as a joke — not as some kind of technical masterpiece (as they should).

## Impressions

By the time I’m writing this post, the GitHub repository has gained **50+ stars**. Not bad for a slang-based language that nobody asked for.

What really mattered to me, though, was what I learned in the process:

- How interpreters work under the hood  
- How community feedback (even playful) can make a project more enjoyable  
- That with **time and dedication**, you can build *anything*

## Current state

Kocha Lang still has its fair share of **limitations and bugs**. I fix them from time to time, and I plan to keep it alive as long as it brings joy (or at least a laugh) to someone out there.

To everyone who supported this project, shared it on social media, or even just wrote a single line of Kocha Lang code — **thank you**. You made this fun little idea feel like something worth doing.
