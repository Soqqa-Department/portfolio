In the summer of 2024, I set myself a small personal challenge:  
**write a simple interpreter from scratch**.  

That’s it. No grand vision, no “next big thing” in programming.  
Just me, some free time, and the curiosity to try something new.

At first, Kocha Lang wasn’t even *Kocha Lang*. The original goal was to build a bare-bones interpreter — a learning project to stretch my skills. But somewhere along the way, I decided to make the process more fun (and slightly ridiculous).  

That’s how the idea was born:  
> **What if I created a programming language entirely in Uzbek street slang?**  

I figured it would make me laugh while coding. It definitely did.

## Turning a Joke into a Real Project

Once I had the basic functionality working, I thought:  
*"Why keep this to myself? Other people might have fun with it too."*

So I:

- Wrote documentation  
- Created a **basic VS Code extension**  
- Released the project in [Tasdev community](https://t.me/tasdev)

Something that started as a *personal joke* quickly became a talked-about project in local developer communities.  
To be clear, most people treated it as a joke — not as some kind of technical masterpiece (as they should).

## The Numbers, the Reactions, and the Lessons

By the time I’m writing this post, the GitHub repository has gained **50+ stars**. Not bad for a slang-based language that nobody asked for.

What really mattered to me, though, was what I learned in the process:

- How interpreters work under the hood  
- How community feedback (even playful) can make a project more enjoyable  
- That with **time and dedication**, you can build *anything*

## Still Alive, Still Fixing Bugs

Kocha Lang still has its fair share of **limitations and bugs**. I fix them from time to time, and I plan to keep it alive as long as it brings joy (or at least a laugh) to someone out there.

To everyone who supported this project, shared it on social media, or even just wrote a single line of Kocha Lang code — **thank you**. You made this fun little idea feel like something worth doing.
