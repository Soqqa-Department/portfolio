### Games

The first time I played GTA: Vice City on my home computer, I was shocked.
*"How can this metal box have an entire world inside?"* I thought, completely fascinated.
That moment sparked my love for computers. Then I found Minecraft, where my childhood creativity was truly sharpened. Its soundtrack still triggers deep nostalgia, reminding me of the past and making me reflect on how time flows in our world.

These days, I occasionally dive into non-competitive games like **Assassinâ€™s Creed** and **Minecraft**. Both offer unique experiences that I cherish. Assassin's Creed, with its sprawling, open worlds, feels like a virtual museum where I can explore history and culture. Minecraft, on the other hand, is where I connect with friends, casually discussing life while mining coal ore :)

Another passion of mine is **modding games**, especially older ones. I love building on top of classic titles, shaping experiences that fit my vision, and hosting multiplayer servers for them. For instance, I currently run an active **CS 1.6** server on a VPS. To expose my local game server's traffic to the internet using reverse-proxy tools like [rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole).

### Movies

Iâ€™ve always been drawn to films that make me think and reflect on life. These kinds of movies challenge my perspective, make me question reality, and push me to rethink the choices we make. Theyâ€™re more than just entertainment; they linger in my mind, sparking thoughts long after the credits roll.

Here are some of my favorites:

- Interstellar
- Groundhog Day
- Yes Man
- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
- Source Code
- Inception
- Back to the Future
- The Matrix
- The Truman Show
- Passengers
