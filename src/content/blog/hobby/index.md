<!-- ### Games
I was shocked when I played GTA VC in my house computer as a child.\
*- "How that metal box can have an entire world inside?"* I thought.
This is how I discovered that I love computers. Especially, when i come upon a game
called Minecraft, a place where my naive childhood creativity was
sharpended, i was fascinated by it. The soundtrack of minecraft is really high
nostalgia trigger for me. It reminds me about the past, and makes me rethink and
analyze how time works in our world.

Nowadays, i ocasionally play non-compatitive games like Assasins Creed, Minecraft.
I love how those gave me absolute unique feelings. Assasins Creed series is a open-world
museum where you can explore the history and culture. Minecraft is a nice place to discuss
different topics with friends while mining a coal ore :).

Moreover, i like to mod games. Especially the older one. I like to build experiences i want on top of
old popular games and host multiplayer server for them. For example, right know i have my own active cs 1.6 
server running on vps. I like reverse-proxy tools that help me with exposing local game's server trafic
to the internet bypassing a NAT. I use [rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole) for that purpose. -->

### Games

The first time I played GTA: Vice City on my home computer, I was shocked.
*"How can this metal box have an entire world inside?"* I thought, completely fascinated.
That moment sparked my love for computers. Then I found Minecraft, where my childhood creativity was truly sharpened. Its soundtrack still triggers deep nostalgia, reminding me of the past and making me reflect on how time flows in our world.



These days, I occasionally dive into non-competitive games like **Assassinâ€™s Creed** and **Minecraft**. Both offer unique experiences that I cherish. Assassin's Creed, with its sprawling, open worlds, feels like a virtual museum where I can explore history and culture. Minecraft, on the other hand, is where I connect with friends, casually discussing life while mining coal ore :)

Another passion of mine is **modding games**, especially older ones. I love building on top of classic titles, shaping experiences that fit my vision, and hosting multiplayer servers for them. For instance, I currently run an active **CS 1.6** server on a VPS. To expose my local game server's traffic to the internet using reverse-proxy tools like [rathole](https://github.com/rapiz1/rathole).

Here are some of my favorites:

- Interstellar
- Groundhog Day
- Yes Man
- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

- Inception
- Back to the Future
