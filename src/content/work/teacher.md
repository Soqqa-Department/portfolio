I taught basic C++ programming to children, covering essential programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditions, and functions. I developed a fun and engaging curriculum tailored to young learners, focusing on problem-solving and fostering an interest in programming. Through hands-on activities and projects, students gained foundational skills and confidence in coding.
