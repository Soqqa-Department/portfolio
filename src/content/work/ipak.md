At Ipak Yuli Bank, I contribute to both legacy and modern web projects, primarily using the Vue.js ecosystem.
- Migrated Vue 2.6 project to Vue 2.7 and from Vue CLI to Vite, cutting CI/CD build times by 50% and reducing dependencies by ~100 MB. 
- Build new Vue 3 projects with Pinia and a custom UI library.
- Lead code reviews, mentor new hires, and conduct technical interviews. 
- Implemented WebSocket-based services for real-time notifications and client-side analytics, improving user experience and enabling better system monitoring.
- Improved code quality by integrating ESLint with a custom ruleset.
