I developed a CRM system for a local clinic, managing patient queues, storing diagnoses, and integrating an admin panel for report generation. Using Vue 3, JavaScript, and MongoDB, I led the full UI/UX development, created unit tests, handled REST API setup, and contributed to backend tasks. I deployed the app on a VPS, configuring Nginx, Docker Compose, and Elasticsearch. Working in a small team, I focused on the frontend, collaborating with a backend developer and the clinic's doctor to optimize the workflow.
