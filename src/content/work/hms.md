I worked on developing a CRM system for a local clinic.
The system managed patient queues, stored diagnoses and other clinic data,
and included an admin panel for generating reports.

##### Technology stack
Vue 3, JavaScript, PrimeVue, TailwindCSS, Chart.js, ESLint, Vite, Vitest,
Postman, Node.js, MongoDB, Nginx, Docker Compose, Elasticsearch

##### Responsibilities

- Full UI/UX development of the project
- Writing clean and reusable code
- Creating tests (Unit)
- Setting up REST API requests
- Coordinating tasks for the team and collaborating with the clinicâ€™s doctor to optimize workflows
- Handling backend tasks as needed

##### Deployment
I deployed the application on a raw VPS, set up a self-hosted MongoDB database, configured Nginx and Docker Compose for container orchestration, and implemented Elasticsearch for logging.

##### Team
There were only two people responsible for the technical implementation of the project: I handled the frontend (and parts of the backend), while my teammate worked on the backend (Node.js). A doctor from the clinic also worked with us to optimize the system for their workflow.
