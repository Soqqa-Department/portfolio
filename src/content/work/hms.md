Developed a full clinic management system from scratch, powering the day-to-day operations of a medium-sized clinic,
including patient flow, medical records, administration, and reporting.

Thanks to an intuitive design and close collaboration with clinic staff, the system was quickly adopted and well received,
becoming a trusted tool for managing daily operations.
